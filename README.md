# open-internet

## What is this all about?

Internet, as we know of, is no longer open or accessible without selling one's privacy to huge corporations. With this organization, I aim to collect and contribute open source technologies from search engines to decentralized social media.

## Aim

1. Collection of open-source projects which allow day-to-day surfing of the web without getting tracked.
2. Social Profile as an opt-in feature.
3. Decentralized.

## Contribution

If you are an open-source developer, you can submit pull requests to list and categorize your creation in this organization.
